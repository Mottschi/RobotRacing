# RobotRacing

## About the Game
In RobotRacing, you will give commands to a little robot, trying to guide him through a landscape and to the finish flags. Make sure to avoid running into any obstacles on your way!

This game was developed within one week as my first project during the [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/en) web development bootcamp.

## How to play
RobotRacing is a turn-based game. Every turn, you will roll a number of six-sided dice, which will each display any one of the following symbols:

### Move One
![Move One](/assets/images/icons/1-solid.png)
Choosing this option will make your robot move one step in the direction it is currently facing.

### Move Two
![Move Two](/assets/images/icons/2-solid.png)
Choosing this option will make your robot move two steps in the direction it is currently facing.


### Move Three
![Move Three](/assets/images/icons/3-solid.png)
Choosing this option will make your robot move three steps in the direction it is currently facing.


### Step Backwards
![Move Backward](/assets/images/icons/arrow-down-long-solid.png)
Choosing this option will make your robot move one step in the direction away from where it is currently facing, without changing that direction.


### Turn Left
![Turn Left](/assets/images/icons/arrow-rotate-left-solid.png)
Choosing this option will make your robot turn 90 degrees to the left.


### Turn Right

Choosing this option will make your robot turn 90 degrees to the right.

## Movement
Each turn you will have to pick three of the movement-options you are presented with, like this:

![Movement UI](/assets/images/movement.png)

As you pick your moves, they will be added to the queue below. The chosen moves from the queue will be executed in the order you picked them. **Once picked, there is no way to reverse that decision**, so choose carefully!

## Terrain
The map is diviged into a grid of tiles with different terrain.

### Grass

Your robot can move through this terrain without encountering any problems.

### Mountains/Rock
![Mountain/Rock](/assets/images/tiles/rock3-small.png)

Your robot is unable to enter this terrain. Trying to do so will have your robot come to a stop right in front of the tile with the mountain area, while taking one point of damage. Your robot will continue with any remaining moves from that tile on, so be careful not to run into the same mountain again and again, repeatedly taking damage!

### Water

Your robot can technically enter this terrain, but will drown. That will cause him to reset - he will be placed back at the location where he started the current turn, skipping any remaining moves that turn, while also taking one point of damage!

### Lava

Your robot can technically enter this terrain, but will be destroyed when doing so, losing all remaining lifes and thus, the game!

## The finish-line
![Finish-flag](/assets/images/flag2.png)

When you end a move on the tile holding this flag, you will complete the current map. The game will grant you one extra life (up to a maximum of 5 life) and move on to the next map.

## Endless mode
The first 3 maps in this game will always be the same 3 maps, but after you complete all of these in order, you will reach the endless mode, where you will continue to be challenged by randomly generated maps until you finally run out of lifes.
